## What this project is about
This project is the result of a 2.5 days hackathon challange from Codaisseur. The morning of the first day of the project a random theme was selected **STRESS**, and you had to come up with your own idea for an app. There were no rules, except for: using the theme, and a new technology. I decided to try out and learn about Styled Components!
