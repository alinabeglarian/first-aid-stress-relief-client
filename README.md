## What this project is about
This project is the result of a 2.5 days hackathon challange from Codaisseur. The morning of the first day of the project a random theme was selected (**STRESS** :fearful:), and you had to come up with your own idea for an app. There were no rules, except for: using the theme, and a new technology. I decided to try out and learn about Styled Components!

## Goals for this project
The goal for this project was to build a working stress-related app in 2.5 days, while using a new technology. 
My personal goal for this project was to make an app, where I could practice my CSS skills and make a polished, nice looking app. Because we had to use a new technology, I decided to learn Styled Components for this reason.

## Create React App

This project was made using the create-react-app cli.
